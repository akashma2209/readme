## Project Overview
This project involves building a 5G testbed using open-source platforms like **Open5GS**, **Free5GC**, and **UERANSIM**, alongside implementing **Machine Learning (ML)** models to optimize resource allocation. The project aims to simulate real-world 5G network scenarios and apply ML techniques to enhance bandwidth usage, reduce latency, and improve resource efficiency.

## Objectives
1. To establish a fully functional 5G standalone (SA) core network using **Open5GS** and **Free5GC**.
2. To simulate radio access and user equipment (UE) using **UERANSIM**.
3. To analyze network performance metrics such as latency, signal strength, and bandwidth usage.
4. To implement and compare **Linear Regression**, **Polynomial Regression**, and **XGBoost** for resource allocation optimization.
5. To address and document troubleshooting and errors encountered during implementation.

## System Architecture
The system architecture is composed of:
- **5G Core Network:** Implemented using **Open5GS** and **Free5GC**, including AMF, SMF, NRF, UDM, and AUSF.
- **Radio Access Network:** Simulated using **UERANSIM**, creating virtual gNodeB and UE instances.
- **Database:** MongoDB is used to store subscriber information (IMSI, keys, etc.).
- **Machine Learning Component:** Python-based ML models (Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and XGBoost) are used to optimize resource allocation.

## Machine Learning Approach
The project utilized three models to optimize resource allocation within the 5G network:

1. **Linear Regression**: 
   - Used to establish baseline predictions.
   - Performance: R² = 0.54

2. **Polynomial Regression**:
   - Captures non-linear relationships in network parameters.
   - Performance: R² = 0.74

3. **XGBoost**:
   - Final and most effective model.
   - Achieved R² = 0.91

### Dataset Features:
The dataset included the following key metrics:
- **Timestamp**: Time of metric recording.
- **Signal Strength (dBm)**: Measured power level at the receiver.
- **Latency (ms)**: Round-trip time between UE and the server.
- **Bandwidth Usage (Mbps)**: Data transmission rate.
- **Active Users**: Number of concurrent users.

## Results and Analysis
1. Successfully set up **Open5GS**, **Free5GC**, and **UERANSIM** for emulating the 5G core and radio access networks.
2. Achievements in ML-based resource allocation optimization:
   - Linear Regression R²: 0.19
   - Polynomial Regression R²: 0.59
   - XGBoost R²: 0.71
3. Detailed error analysis and troubleshooting of issues in Open5gs and Free5gs such as:
   - NAS registration errors ([SEMANTICALLY_INCORRECT_MESSAGE]).
   - SCTP connection issues.
   - RRC connection drops.

---

## Troubleshooting and Errors
### Common Issues and Fixes:
1. **SCTP Connection Issues**:
   - Resolved by installing `libsctp-dev` and ensuring proper SCTP endpoint configuration.
2. **NAS Registration Failures**:
   - Corrected IMSI and key values in MongoDB subscriber entries.
3. **RRC Connection Drops**:
   - Fixed inconsistencies in `tac` and `gnbSearchList` settings in `ueransim-gnb.yaml`.
